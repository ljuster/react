## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    /ads
      ads-data.json
    /ads_metrics
      ads_metrics-data.json
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    ObjectDataListStore.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.
