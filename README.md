## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    /ads
      ads-data.json
    /ads_metrics
      ads_metrics-data.json
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    ObjectDataListStore.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.


## How to Start the App

* Make sure you have [node.js installed on your computer] (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Clone or download the src code from [this repository] (https://github.com/ljuster/react)
* Navigate to the folder location in your terminal and enter 
  > npm start
* The app should automatically start and open in your browser!
